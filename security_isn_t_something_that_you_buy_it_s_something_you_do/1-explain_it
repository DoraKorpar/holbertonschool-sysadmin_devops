1. You should generate a public/private ssh key pair using the command line.
2. The public key should be uploaded to the server you will be connecting to. It will be used to verify the private key kept on your computer.
3. The private key should be left in the file in which it is generated. It will be used to identify your computer to the network using the public key.
